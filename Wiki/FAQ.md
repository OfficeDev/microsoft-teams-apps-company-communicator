#Business Justification
How much will this cost?We have a cost estimator calculator here. 
The cost model is structured in such a way that mostcosts are fixed, regardless of the size of organization, with a small amount of variable costs.
The average costs for Company Communicator tend to be between around $75 monthlyfor most organizations.
Long story short, your costs will increase very, very marginally as you increase the number of messages and users.
Here is a real-life example:Ernst &Young (EY) customer reference:"We send out one Company Communicator message to 322k employees, every week. Our total cost in February was $114.
"Please note that your costs will be much more impacted by the Azure tier chosen for delivery speed.
For instance, if EY chose a higher tier/faster delivery Azure service –this would have decreased their current ~3.5 hour delivery time andthey would have incurred a higher cost. 
You can test these changes in the cost estimator above. 
What reporting is available / how do I track clicks and impact?By default, the Application does not track views or read receipts(both are on the backlog).
You can see delivery stats,only. However, we have a variety of options that will allow you to track click rates and more(without custom development required):
  1.Leverage standard SharePoint analytics for visits to your one-pager templates.
  2.Use a tracking URL (e.g. Bitly & TinyURL)to track the clicks on your Adaptive Card button.
  3.Leverage your existing data analytics suite with SharePoint (e.g. Adobe Analytics).
  Customization option:The Microsoft Teams Bot framework(which is used by Company Communicator to send messages) can track reactions.
  This is on our backlog, but with some development work it could be built into your solution. 
  
Are there reference examples from organizations who have done this? 
Absolutely. Check out the customer reference sectionathttps://aka.ms/TeamsBroadcastHub.

#Product Operational:
Can we name the App something other than “Company Communicator?” Of course! Whomever deploys the CC app can name the solution. 
App admins can always go back later and change the name.
We would encourage you to not change the ID, however, so we can support you in your efforts to measure and share your impact within your organization.
Please note that the App must have a globally unique name as part of the Azure services so it has a unique URL. 
This unique name will be separate from the name you choose for the Teams app that users will interact with.
We are simply sharing so this works with your Azure naming standards, if applicable.
How to do it: Go to the Teams App Manifest and simply change the name of the app. How to do this:
1.In the Azure Bot Service: Change the mane of the bot.
2.In the Teams app manifest: Change the name of the app.


Product: Security& Deployment🐱‍👤In which Azure region should I deploy Company Communicator?Ideally, select the same or closet Azure region to your Microsoft Teams location.▪To check where your Teams data islocated -https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/location-of-data-in-teams▪To check Azure services availability ina specific region -https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=functions,service-bus,frontdoor,monitor,bot-service,app-service,storageThereare few regions that do not support all the services required for Company Communicator, like Azure DoD, some Azure Gov region or most recent regions. Please also check that theAzure resourceproviders are activated on your subscription (for Application Insight / Azure Monitor)Go to the Azure Portal > Subscriptions > Resource providers and verify that the following providers are registered:Microsoft.StorageMicrosoft.WebMicrosoft.InsightsMicrosoft.ServiceBusMicrosoft.BotServiceMicrosoft.NetworkWhy does the Company Communicator application needall these permissions?Company Communicator needs permissions to access Microsoft Graph API and read users and groups as well as install the application on behalf of the user.These permissions are documented on GitHub. You can give the application read-only permissions unless you want to pre-install the application to your users without going through Teams Admin Center (TAC) and/orApp Setup policies. If you prefer to deploy Company Communicator via TAC, you do not need any of the App Permissions and can select “false” for “ProactivelyInstallUserApp” during the deployment on Azure.
Can my application be deployed in another tenant and used outside of my company? If so, how do we prevent that from happening?You have control over where your app runs and which users can access the app. Theoretically, yes the manifest couldbedeployed in another tenant by an authorized user. However, since you candefine and control the tenant and users that are authorized to either author messages or receive the messages, we have yet to see this issue arise. These settings are set in the following App Service configuration parameters where the application is hosted:•AllowedTenants –Controls the tenants that can register to the app and receive messages•AuthorizedCreatorUpns –Controls which users in your organization are authorized to author messagesOther considerations:▪Both the author and the bot application are registered into Azure AD –You can review the permissions provided to these applications and verify if other tenants have access to these applications.▪Only users in your organization that haveCompany Communicator installed can receive its messages –You can control who has access to the app via Teams App permission policies.▪As part of its business logic, Company Communicator does not send messages to guests -even if they have the application installed.What are the components of an application hosted by Microsoft Teams?None! Microsoft Teams is not responsible to host any application. More information on Teams App Permissions and Considerations. The only information that is hosted on Teams is the following: •A description of your application including its capabilities (e.g. a bot, a tab) •The scope of your application (e.g. personal app, Teams app)•Your app’s required user permissions (e.g. read user profile) 
•The location of your application (e.g.the URL of a web app, the AppID of your bot)All thisinformation iscontained in a manifest (a json file) along with some icons and optional language files to create a zip file named “Teams application package.How do I make sure that Teams only displays applications that a user has access to?Well, this is a difficult one! Applications in Teams are displayed to users based on the definition of “Application permission policies.”As of today, only a single application policy can be assigned to a given user. If a user has multiple policies assigned, the policy with the highest priority takes precedence. 
Consequently, if you want to apply fine-grained app permission policies to group of users, you would need to create as many policies as there are combination of apps a single user can access. For this reason, we recommend keeping the number of app permission policies as low as possible.Here is a recommended setup:Organization wide settingsTeams application permissionpolicies: Which users have access to which applications?1.A default, organization-wide policy that allowsall Microsoft 1st partyapps+ blocksspecific 3rd-partyapps(e.g.security review not performs / app not approved / risk of shadow IT / ...)+ allowsofficial custom apps –Assignedas default to allemployees.2.A policy, "Teams app dev", that contains the organization-wide policy settings of #1+ enables all custom apps –Assignedtocitizendevs and appdevelopers.3.(Optional) A policy that allows all apps –Assigned to IT admins to review and manage allapps.4.Specific policies to authorize 3rd-party apps blocked in the general policy –Assigned to specific groups of users with businessjustification.Teams application setuppolicies: How do you promote and/or allow users to discoverapplications?1.An organization-wide policy to promote services to all employees (e.g."Enterprise Assistant" / "IT or HR support FAQ").2.A “Teams dev” policy to allow users to “upload custom apps.”3.(Optional) Geo-based policies for localized apps andservices(e.g. for specific regulations).4.(Optional) Function-based policies aligned toemployeeroles in the organization (e.g. Sales / Marketing / Engineering specific apps).

What is the communication flow between Teams and my application?Or“Where does my data go while at rest and in transit?”Microsoft Teams does not host any application, only the definition of the application in the form of a manifest. So, part of this answer comesfrom the application ownersthemselves, who define the technical implementation: Azure? Power Platform? 3rd-party? In an organization-specific on-prem / other cloud platform?There are several integration points in Teams(aka “capabilities” -tabs, cards, bots, message extension, webhooks, etc.) that all fall under 2 generic patterns: web apps and bots. In both cases, the communication between your Teams client (web, mobile or desktop) and your applications:-Is over HTTPS (port 443) to/from Microsoft Teams public IP range 52.112.0.0/14.-Directly happens between Microsoft Teams and your app / bot.-Requires Teams to reach a public endpoint on the application-side.-Is possible via the Teams app package that whiteliststhe authorized endpoints for an app.
How can I develop a Teams application in a “purely local” environment?“Purely local” development means that your development environment is not connected to Internet or that you have limited permissions to access or use the Internet (e.g. restricted ports or services).This requirement is common from, but not limited to, Federal and Financial services company. Fora Teams Tab:All you need is https to run your application locally. Then,you can test your app directly from Microsoft Teams using this local URL in the application manifest.For a Teams Bot:The commonapproach is to use a tunneling solution like ngrok. This solution is not compatible with a “purely local” environment and you’ll need to use the Azure Bot Emulator as described here -Choosing a setup to test and debug your app -Teams | Microsoft Docs.Azure Bot Emulator does not support Microsoft Teams-specific messagesand does not emulate Microsoft Teams client. However, starting withversion 4.11 of the Bot Emulator, you can send “custom activities” to your bot and simulate Microsoft Teams activity messages.From the Bot Emulator, select “Conversation” > “Send activity system” > “custom activity” and then copy / paste the activity message you want to send to your bot.How to I secure my applicationfor Microsoft Teams behind a firewall?This setup is documented on this blog post: Bots Secured Behind a Firewall& Teams-Microsoft Bot Framework.What should I do when my App Template deployment fails?If you use App Templates provided on OfficeDev GitHub, you may experience errors during the deployment related to “Source Control.” In many cases, this error is related to a time-out during the installation process of the application on the Azure App Service. If this problem happens, we recommend the following options:Option 1–Check deployments status for each App Service:1.Go into the Azure portal, open the Azure App Service, go under “Deployment Center” and then the “Logs” tab.2.Check the status of the latest deploymenta.If it is “running..” wait till it terminatesb.If it is “success” then everything went fine –nothing to doc.If it is “failure”, select the commit ID and press “Redeploy commit” –This should solve the problem if the issue was related to a deployment timeout
Option 2–Change the deployment model to Zip deployment:This deployment mechanism provides more reliability and performances to deploy the application –It requires to move the build pipeline out side of Kudu to a GitHub Actions (or other CD/CI tool) –Documentation is provided here on GitHub
