## Assumptions

The estimate below assumes:
* 1000 users in the tenant
* 1 message sent to all users each week (~5/month)
* Administrator opts to create a custom domain name and obtain an SSL certificate for the site. 
    * When purchased through Azure, this is *typically* ~$12 for a domain name, and $75/year for the SSL certificate.
    * If you choose to use Azure Front Door, that adds a monthly cost of $46 (for 2 routing rules + minimal bandwidth consumption).

> The template defaults to using Azure Front Door, to reduce the cost of trying out and experimenting with the template, rather than requiring you to get a custom domain outright. For instance, you can run your instance for a few days, then turn off the services, and only pay for your actual Azure usage when the services were on.

We ignore:
* Operations associated with app installations, as that happens only once per user/team
* Operations associated with the authors viewing the tab, given the assumption that they are sending only 5 messages/month.
* Executions associated with Prep or Send function, as the execution count is trivial to the calculations.

## SKU recommendations

The recommended SKUs for a production environment are:
* App Service: Standard (S2)
* Service Bus: Basic

## Estimated load

**Number of messages sent**: 1000 users * 5 messages/month = 5000 messages

**Data storage**: 1 GB max    
* Messages are on the order of KBs

**Table data operations**:

* Prep function
    * (3 read * 5000 messages) = 15000 reads

* Send function
    * (4 read * 5000 messages) = 20000 reads
    * (1 write * 5000 messages) = 5000 writes

* Data function
    * Aggregating status: (1 read * 5000 messages) = 5000 reads

**Service bus operations**:
* ((1 write + 1 read) operations/sent message * 5000 messages) = 10000 operations

**Azure Function**:
> For Gb-sec pricing calculation, please refer this formula.
(Memory Size * Execution Time * Execution Count)/1024000.
Min. memory size = 128 Mb. 
Min. execution time = 100 ms.

* Send function
    * (1 invocation * 5000 messages) = 5000 invocations
    * (128 Mb * 3000 * 5000 messages)/1024000 = 1875 Gb-sec

## Estimated cost

**IMPORTANT:** This is only an estimate, based on the assumptions above. Your actual costs may vary.
