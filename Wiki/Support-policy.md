## For owners of personalized Company Communicator editions

If you are using modified versions of Company Communicator, you may need to adjust your code base to stay current with the latest updates from the official repo. Here are the principal areas that have been impacted by the recent updates:

- **Authorization problem:** Version 5.5 has been launched by the official repo to address the authorization issue that happened when the redirect removed the Authorization header. This version offers a temporary solution. 
We have released a permanent fix to the authorization issue in v5.5.2 which involves change in Azure front door routing rules. Please find the below link for detailed steps to mitigate the authorization issue: [Authorization issue mitigation steps](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-company-communicator/wiki/Authorization-issue-fix).
- **Application Insights migration:** The official repo has moved to workspace-based Application Insights, as the classic Application Insights in Azure Monitor will be retired on 29 February 2024. This version creates a new Log Analytics workspace as part of version 5.5.1. For details, please refer to the [Weâ€™re retiring Classic Application Insights on 29 February 2024](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/we-re-retiring-classic-application-insights-on-29-february-2024/).
